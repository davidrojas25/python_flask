        <p class="card-text">What an amazing experience to match the amazing accomplishment by our warriors this last season! Our warriors traveled to Madison WI to race against the very best runners in the country!braving the cold and travel and placing amounts the very best in those races! Besides the incredible racing experience our warriors had a chance to participate in opening ceremonies, pre-race dinner, team meetings, visit the WI state capitol, tour of Chicago, and even a trip to the tallest buildings! Not to mention ice skating, world famous deep dish pizza, and trolley ride! Fun and excitement was the name of the game on this trip! To say our kids enjoyed themselves is an understatement. On top of that it was exciting to see the energy these kids are bringing back to the rest of the team and to our program overall! Eager to start the next season and accomplish even more! As huge as this event was for us we hope to take it a step further in 2020 and with the energy of both kids and parents I have no doubt we will grow and accomplish more very soon! Stay tuned on what your Warriors are up to next! Enjoy the slide show! </p>

        <p class="card-text">Two short years ago I started a low-cost youth running program for the Whittier area. I hoped to develop strong, tenacious runners who might someday compete against the best in the region and the country, but I knew this would be a process that would take time. 

            Imagine my pride and excitement when, two short years later, four young Whittier runners qualified for the USATF Regional Championships. As if that weren't enough, today was a momentous day for the Whittier community, our kids, and our team! Those four kids, ages 8-12, ran the races of their lives at the regional championships, and all four managed to qualify to run against the very best youth runners in the country at the USATF National Cross Country Championships in Madison, Wisconsin!
            
            This is a tremendous success for our young program and goes far beyond anything we had expected to achieve by this point, but it is also a big financial hardship for our families at a time of year where funds can already start to feel pretty tight. We don't want any kid to miss out on this opportunity and experience, and we need to raise the money quickly. Please consider donating (no amount too small!) and sharing to help all of our qualifying kids get to Nationals! Note: All funds received will pay to cover the costs only for the kids, not a coach or parent. This is about giving them an amazing opportunity they have earned!</p>
