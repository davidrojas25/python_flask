            <p>Let's clear up some facts about Marathon Pace training runs. Unfortunately they have been given a bad reputation due to their name. Well and I shouldn't say bad but definitely a confusing reputation. When we hear of marathon pace training runs as part of a runner's workout regiment we automatically assume that they must be training for a marathon. While it's logical it'could be very incorrect. Even 5000 meter runners can benefit from running these runs as part of their workout routine.&nbsp; It allows a runner to develop mental and physical stamina more often that just when other forms of speed are through in yet they are workouts that a runner can recover from easier than most other forms of speed.<br /><br />Now keep in mind for marathons, yes these are amazing and should be a key component of any marathon training regiment. What many don't know if that marathon pace training runs can be used during training cycles for almost any distance race. If you are training for a 5K or for a 10K these will come in handy and can give a boost to your training. For example Chris Solinsky former American record holder in the 10,000 meters and first american ever to break 27:00 used this pace training on a regular basis. He says that marathon pace training helps build a stronger foundation on which to introduce interval training which in turn gets you ready to race during season.<br /><br />So how exactly does marathon pace training help? It improves the endurance capacity of your slow-twitch muscles cells. They do this by increasing aerobic energy production in those slow-twitch cells and building more capillaries to carry more oxygen to those cells. Once this begins to happen the runners body&nbsp; increases its ability to export lactate and to reduce acidity which as we know will lead to better running economy. This will allow you to run farther at a faster rate of speed than ever before, translating to faster paces during races of any distance.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now lets add this to your training regiment. To start I would recommend not doing this that often to allow your body to adjust to this or any new addition to your&nbsp; training arsenal. This should be done mostly in your base period of your training cycle and done once every 2 to 3 weeks. If you already have experience with tempos of other speed workouts then doing them weekly or every 10 days will make more sense.&nbsp; Like most harder training days if at all possible make sure you take an easy day after and if possible before as well to allow your body to recover and get stronger. Do this you don't need a track in fact please avoid it unless you just love going in circles of a long time! Find an area where you can run 2 mile or so to warm-up then run 3-6 miles at marathon pace. This should be about 50 to 70 seconds slower than your 5K race pace. If you are a 20 min 5K runner its about 60 seconds or exactly 1 min slower than your 5K pace per mile. If you are faster than that lean more toward the 50 seconds and if you are a bit slower lean more towards the 70 seconds. At the end make sure you cool down with 1 -2 miles of slower running back to your start point.<br /><br />Here is an example of how this would look for a 21:00 5K runner:<br />5K race pace is 6:45 so we add 63 seconds to make our marathon training pace 7:48 so...<br /><br />2 mile warm-up at easy pace<br />3-6 miles at 7:48 (marathon pace)<br />1-2 miles cool-down at easy pace<br /><br />Hope this was helpful and keep chasing your dreams!</p>
